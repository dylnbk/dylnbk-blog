            </div>
        </div>
        <article class="post-content"> <h2><br>Introduction <br><br></h2>
<p>APTs pose a significant and growing risk to global stability. Often nation states or state sponsored groups, they are generally
politically motivated and the impact of their activities can be far reaching for individuals, nations and businesses. Over the years
there have been many attacks on the infrastructure and systems that we all rely on for communication, energy, education,
finance, healthcare and more. Some of the most well known attacks publicized by the media include Stuxnet, a worm that
targeted the nuclear program of Iran, Deep Panda which has been attributed to an ongoing battle between China and the US
and exposed millions of US personnel records, and GhostNet which was a large scale espionage operation that had the ability to
monitor video, audio and the location of infected devices. We will focus on the details surrounding two attacks that
occurred in 2017 using the vulnerability EternalBlue, leading to the network security breaches WannaCry and NotPetya. <br><br><br></p>
<h2>Advanced Persistent Threat Actors <br><br></h2>
<h3>- EternalBlue<br><br></h3>
<p>The name EternalBlue has been given to a critical
Microsoft vulnerability and an exploit allegedly
originating from the Equation Group, an APT actor that
is suspected of being tied to the NSA. It has been
reported that the NSA helped develop EternalBlue as
part of their program of collecting and weaponizing
vulnerabilities, and that it was used in countless
intelligence gathering and counterterrorist missions. It was released in 2017 as part of a
toolkit of weaponized exploits by a group operating
under the name of “The Shadow Brokers”, the
FUZZBUNCH framework included various methods
targeting Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities. <br><br></p>
<p>EternalBlue abuses a critical flaw in any device that
utilises the Server Message Block protocol. The SMB, which was first developed in the early
1980s, allows for an authenticated inter process
communication mechanism that is mainly used for
providing shared access to ports, printers and files
between nodes. It lets Windows machines and various
devices talk to one another.<br><br></p>
<p>To gain access to a system, EternalBlue leverages different bugs. The first occurs when the SMB protocol attempts to cast a File
Extended Attribute list structure into a Windows NT FEA structure to determine memory allocation. A mathematical error
creates an integer overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected leading to a buffer overflow. This overflow is
achieved due to a difference in definition between the two sub commands <strong>SMB_COM_TRANSACTION2</strong> and
<strong>SMB_COM_NT_TRANSACT</strong>. Both contain a <strong>_SECONDARY</strong> command that is used when too much data is included in a single
packet, the important part is that <strong>NT_TRANSACT</strong> calls for a packet twice the size of <strong>TRANSACTION2</strong>. A significant error occurs
when the client sends a crafted message using the <strong>NT_TRANSACT</strong> command before <strong>TRANSACTION2</strong>. The protocol assigns type,
size and memory allocation for both packets based only on the last command received, this results in the first packet utilising
more memory than allocated. After the overflow has succeeded, the third bug allows for heap spraying; a method of allocation
that inserts data into certain parts of memory. At this point, the attacker can execute shellcode and take control of the system. <br><br></p>
<h3>- WannaCry<br><br></h3>
<p>Whereas EternalBlue is a method to gain access to networks
and devices, WannaCry is ransomware that encrypts users
data and demands that ransom payments are made in order
to decrypt them. In May 2017, the WannaCry attack was
estimated to have infected more than 200,000 computers
around the world. It is believed that the APT actor known as
the Lazarus Group is responsible.<br><br></p>
<p>The process uses a combination of EternalBlue and a trojan
named DoublePulsar to gain access and then establish
persistence on the victim’s device. WannaCry itself is made of
two main parts, a ransomware component and a worm used to spread the malware. It was able to spread in such an efficient
manner as it capitalised on EternalBlue and the ability to beacon out and propagate to other potential SMB targets on
connected networks, without any user interaction. The dropper creates a service that masquerades as a
Microsoft executable and it extracts the encrypting tool. Several files are then positioned in the working directory, it attempts to
grant them all full access and change their attributes to hidden. At this point using RSA and AES libraries, WannaCry begins to
encrypt the users’ files. All logical drives are searched and a variety of file extensions are targeted. It launches
@WanaDecryptor@.exe which displays the timers and ransom note, after the second timer expires the user is advised that the
files are no longer recoverable.<br><br></p>
<h3>- NotPetya<br><br></h3>
<p>NotPetya has been called ransomware, but analysts have
noted it is more likely that the motivation behind this attack
was aimed at the destruction of systems rather than financial
incentives. <br><br></p>
<p>It began around June 2017 with a campaign of malware laden
emails, and an update that deployed the NotPetya payload.dll
to users of the compromised Ukrainian accounting software
“M.E. Doc”, a program being used by most of the country’s
financial and government institutions. The executable uses
faked Microsoft digital signatures to fool virus scanners, when
the malware began spreading only two anti-virus engines on the VirusTotal roster flagged it as dangerous.
Following execution of the malware, it checks to see if the EternalBlue vulnerability has been patched before searching for
additional propagation paths and encrypting the users’ data. If the system has been patched NotPetya uses a Mimikatz based
technique that takes credentials from the Windows LSASS. The collected credentials are then used in an attempt to gain access
and control with PsExec. From here the master boot record is overwritten and modified, the system restarts and displays a
fictitious “chkdsk.exe” partition repair screen while it encrypts the users’ data. Finally the ransom note is displayed, there is no
evidence that users’ files will be decrypted if they pay the fee.<br><br><br></p>
<h2>Impact <br><br></h2>
<p>The effects of these huge network breaches can be felt all over the world, tens of thousands of organizations have been infected
with malware such as WannaCry and NotPetya. In the UK, the WannaCry outbreak shut down computers in over 80 NHS
organizations causing thousands of cancelled appointments, GP surgeries reverted to pen and paper and hospitals turned away
ambulances. After installing a new software tool, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing company fell victim to
WannaCry causing affected tools to become inoperable and unable to function normally, resulting in what could cost the
company $170 million . Due to lost productivity, the cost of forensic investigations and the restoration of data, the
total global financial and economic impact from the WannaCry attack could amount to billions of dollars, with some estimates
predicting losses of up to $4 billion.<br><br></p>
<p>NotPetya has been attributed to the Sandworm Team, a Russian backed APT. US officials charged six suspects, claiming that on
behalf of the Russian government they conducted attacks intended to destabilize and interfere with other countries, causing
chaos and monetary losses. Despite originating in Ukraine, the malware quickly spread across the globe and
locked up devices at various multi billion dollar companies such as FedEx, MSD, Cadbury and Maersk. Experts believe that these
ransomware attacks are often being used as a smokescreen, obfuscating and diverting blame from the countries that are
actually responsible. Collateral damage occurs when civilians get caught in the crossfire; hospitals, power grids, universities,
airports and more have suffered service outages, leading to the disruption of urgently required facilities. In the case
of both WannaCry and NotPetya, users’ files were generally lost forever as paying the fee would not decrypt the data.<br><br></p>
<p>So far, the Shadow Brokers’ leak of EternalBlue has led to some of the most serious network breaches on record. As digital
technologies become deeply engrained into everybody’s daily life, we are becoming increasingly open to new threats. Although
Microsoft has patched the vulnerability, as of June 2020 Avast is still blocking roughly 20 million EternalBlue attacks every month
and up to a million machines still use the at-risk SMB protocol. There are further concerns of new threats as a result of the leak,
the most dangerous dubbed as EternalRocks which uses multiple exploits to infect systems. <br><br><br></p>
<h2>Mitigation <br><br></h2>
<p>There are steps that can be taken to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. Since the EnternalBlue leak,
Microsoft has attempted to rally the NSA and other government bodies to back a Digital Geneva Convention, calling for an end
to the nation state stockpiling of vulnerabilities. The increasing scale and scope of cyber-attacks and their
capacity to affect the safety and security of civilian life highlights the need for international law to be modernized. Although it
should be expected that individuals and organizations consider their digital safety as a priority and do their best to protect their
systems, perhaps more can be done from a regulatory perspective to reign in state backed threats.<br><br></p>
<p>One of the important ways to remain protected from vulnerabilities such as EternalBlue, is to keep systems up to date.
Microsoft deployed a security patch to Windows users almost a month before the exploit was leaked, nevertheless a significant
number of devices are still not updated. If for some reason updating a system is not possible, another less practical strategy for
protecting against EternalBlue would be to disable the SMB protocol and refrain from connecting the machine to the internet.<br><br></p>
<p>As the WannaCry ransomware leveraged the EternalBlue and DoublePulsar exploits, updating devices to the latest version of
Windows is still the best way to avoid infection. Another useful mitigation technique is to disable all unnecessary protocols. The
SMB setting is enabled on many machines, but ultimately is not needed by the majority. Disabling SMB and other
communication protocols if they are not in use is a good way to stop the rapid spread of this kind of malware. Network
segmentation, splitting the network into subsets, can also greatly improve security and such precautions can prevent an
outbreak from spreading, thus reducing exposure of essential systems. <br><br></p>
<p>Creating destruction resistant backups of critical systems and data is also a crucial part of recovering against an attack. Isolating
or retiring computers that cannot be patched and the immediate deployment of security updates for the operating system,
browser and core applications where possible is integral to protecting any network. For malware such as NotPetya, which used a
Mimikatz based method to steal credentials, it is wise to implement unique local admin passwords and separate and protect
privileged accounts.<br><br><br></p>
<h2>Security Issues Within a Lan/Wan Environment <br><br></h2>
<p>Local area networks and wide area
networks both suffer from various
security issues and steps can be taken to
harden defenses and mitigate from
serious disruption of service. <br><br></p>
<p>LAN is typically more secure by default,
as it is used by a single organization or
department and is local with its
resources managed in-house. Typically,
malware is introduced accidentally via a
phishing scheme or by connecting a
compromised device to the network.
Enforcing rigorous security policies and
procedures for those with physical access to equipment and ensuring that users do not have unnecessary permissions can
provide a good layer of security. LANs will connect via a central router, remaining vigilant and changing router
admin credentials regularly along with strict firewall filters, strong encryption and a VPN are all good measures to consider.<br><br></p>
<p>Linking LANs in different locations, known as a WAN, requires connecting to either the public internet or a dedicated connection.
This makes it more difficult to control as individuals and organizations cannot guarantee what protections have been made to
third party systems, it essentially adds more threats on top of those that already exist in a LAN only environment. The use of a
VPN is a popular way to create a secure connection between locations, when there is a need to rely on public or third party
infrastructure it ensures that data is encrypted as it travels. <br><br></p>
<p>With software defined WAN and
networking, security is moved from
centralized firewalls and switches to edge
locations. As more employees work from
home and operate from less traditional
locations, security is becoming a more
challenging prospect. SD-WAN goes from a
single strong firewall to each user being
provisioned for independently, using a more
flexible security profile. It negates the need
for expensive hardware centric approaches
and instead opts for a software based
solution.  <br><br><br></p>
<h2>Summary <br><br></h2>
<p>We are now so accustomed to digital technologies that often we use our phones and computers as an extension of ourselves,
without much thought behind how it works. We have accepted devices into our lives that collect and transfer huge amounts of
very personal and sensitive information, some of these devices and systems manage many critical aspects of society.
Unfortunately there will always be groups that attempt to capitalize on weakness, it will take significant efforts to combat these
threats to our privacy, security and public services. With the right measures and by promoting best practices to individuals and
organizations, we can limit the damage that can be done by APTs. <br><br></p>
