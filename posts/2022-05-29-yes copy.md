It isn’t a war; it’s a choice. The Angular, React, Vue and Svelte (the newer kid on the block) web frameworks all solve different problems. And a lot of that choice comes down to development style. Angular provides more of a guided path, while React feels more “choose your own adventure.” Angular is extremely opinionated, React is less so and Vue is in the middle.
